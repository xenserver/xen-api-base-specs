Subject: [PATCH] CA-218219: precheck index range before accessing

This is similar to the CA-139732 case fixed previously, just a different
occurence. Basically, when there is a chain of VHDs of different sizes (i.e.
there was resize operation in history), we'd better check if the index is in
range before accessing the data.
